                        On August 12, 1939, United Bank Of America, founded as United Bank Of America celebrated 81 years of service to the people of New York City and its neighboring communities we so proudly serve. During these years, we endured one world war, the Great Depression, and countless other political and economic events. We consider those years a success for the simple fact that we survived. That alone places us among few other banks that can boast the same distinction.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Another way that we might evaluate these 81 years is in terms of growth. When we opened in August 1939,The United Bank Of America had paid capital stock of $15,000 and by October 1940, we had assets totaling $44,668. Growth and prosperity endured through the decades. During the 1960s and 1970s, the bank expanded its Main office time and the bank experienced the most rapid growth in its history achieving a growth rate of 406 percent. We concluded the decade in 1979 with total assets of $45.7 million.</p>

                        <p>During 1982,The United Bank Of America headed into this decade with a host of technological improvements including ATMs, Advantage 24 Bankline telephone service, check imaging, and more.
